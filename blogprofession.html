                <p>Last Friday, we had a company Safari. In the morning, we attended two presentations of IT companies, and in
                    the afternoon we
                    looked online at some other IT companies. From those, I chose three companies that interested me the most.
                    In this blogpost,
                    you will read what the companies do and what my pros and cons are. You can click on the posters, to be able
                    to read them better.

                <h3>What is SAP?</h3>
                <p>SAP is one of the world's leading producers of software for the management of business processes,
                    developing
                    solutions that facilitate effective data processing and information flow across organizations. They
                    are
                    headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, with more than 101,000 employees spread out over more than 78
                    countries.
                </p>
                <h3>Why would I like to work at SAP in the future?</h3>
                <p>I really like the fact that employees are allowed to work in varying departments based on skill and
                    interest. So especially for someone that is just entering the corporate world, it's good to have the
                    opportunity to find out what IT profession fits the best.
                    It also sounds like they are always open for feedback, even when you are there as an intern. There
                    are
                    many possibilities for interns or new grads, so that is great.
                </p>
                <h3>The cons of working at SAP</h3>
                <p>I think being such a big company has both pros and cons. Mostly in companies of this size, you get to
                    work on one small thing for various projects and everything has to be done in a certain way. I
                    couldn't
                    find anywhere if this was actually the case, so maybe it is just me being biased.

            <article class="item6">
                <h3>What is Syntess?</h3>
                <p>
                    Syntess Software is producer of ERP- and mobile software in the Netherlands.
                    Syntess' customers include installation, companies, companies in the construction
                    sectior, nautical sector, maintenance companies and mechanical engineering companies.<br>
                    Syntess is established in Zierikzee and Gorinchem. The company has no fewer than 3,000
                    partners who use their software. Furthermore, the company has more than 130 active employees.
                </p>
                <h3>Why would I like to work at Syntess in the future?</h3>
                <p>
                    It maybe is a superficial reason, but it is established near where I live. I am not planning on
                    moving for a future job, so it is great when I don't have to travel too far everyday.
                    Furthermore, it has quite a lot of partners who use the software, but not too much employees. A
                    pro of working at a company that is not that big, is that it will most likely be more flat than
                    bigger companies, where, so to speak, a manager could help you out when you are stuck.
                </p>
                <h3>The cons of working at Syntess</h3>
                <p>
                    Opposite of SAP, working at a smaller companies also has pros and cons. You maybe wouldn't have as
                    big opportunities as at a bigger companies as to finding out what you like and trying different
                    things.
                    Overall, I do think a smaller company fits me better.

            <article class="item-2-and-8">
                <h3>What is Maxxton?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Maxxton Group is the leading provider of IT services and consultancy for the broader hospitality
                    and
                    accommodation rental sector. Originally a DUtch company, since its formation in 1998, Maxxton has
                    grown into a
                    multinational organization with operations in three continents and clients spread across the
                    globe.<br>
                    Maxxton has developed and perfected a holistic ERP approach to technology in hospitality and tourism
                    and a suite
                    of solutions to suit the needs of most complex organizations. This means that they deliver efficient
                    solutions,
                    adapted to each client's needs, which means that we are very flexible in the delivery of our
                    technology and fully
                    adapt it according to requirements. Our developments and continuous updates are driven by the
                    in-depth knowledge
                    of our market and our clients, with which we work as true partners and which are both beneficiaries
                    and initiators
                    of our continuous software enhancement.
                </p>
                <h3>Why would I like to work at Maxxton in the future?</h3>
                <p>
                    What attracts me the most to Maxxton, is the fact that they adapt their software for each customer.
                    So every time
                    there is a new customer, they will look at what they want and what is possible. To try and meet
                    their needs as much
                    as possible, sounds like a really fun and challenging job. Also the fact that they keep developing
                    and updating the
                    software, so you have to try and see what can be better now, even after you just finished your last
                    change.<br>
                    On the website of Maxxton, it is clear that they have grown a lot, but still want to grow further.
                    But it feels like
                    the culture is not going to change, it keeps the smaller company culture, even if it grows a lot.
                </p>
                <h3>The cons of working at Maxxton</h3>
                <p>
                    As I said, it is a fast growing company, which maybe means that there is a lot of pressure on the
                    developers, you
                    have to deliver good work and fast. This is also the fun part, but sometimes the pressure gets to
                    too high standards.
                    But I have no idea if that is the case at Maxxton.

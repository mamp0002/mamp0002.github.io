                <h3>Why would I like to work there in the future?</h3>
                <p>I really like the fact that employees are allowed to work in varying departments based on skill and
                    interest. So especially for someone that is just entering the corporate world, it's good to have the
                    opportunity to find out what IT profession fits the best.
                    It also sounds like they are always open for feedback, even when you are there as an intern. There are 
                    many possibilities for interns or new grads, so that is great.
                </p>
                <h3>The cons of working there</h3>
                <p>I think being such a big company has both pros and cons. Mostly in companies of this size, you get to
                    work on one small thing for various projects and everything has to be done in a certain way. I couldn't 
                    find anywhere if this was actually the case, so maybe it is just me being biased.

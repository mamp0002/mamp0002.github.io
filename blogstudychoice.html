        <h2>Why I chose ICT</h2>
        <p>For a long time, I didn&#8217t know what I wanted to do. I have tried a studies at Law school and a
            Mathematics
            studies. Both were not the right choice for me. After I quit the last studies, I took two years off from
            school.
            I worked for a year and I really wanted to make sure that I was going to make the right choice for myself.
            My dad is the founder of a very successful ICT-company. I think deep down I always knew I had a passion for
            ICT;
            when I was younger I wanted to go with him to work often, and I wanted to &#x0022help&#x0022 in my spare
            time doing
            basic
            things for him.
            So ICT was and is always connected to my dad. I think at first I didn&#8217t want to admit that I had a
            passion
            for
            ICT, because I was afraid that people were going to think that I was just going in the same route as my dad
            and
            always compare me to him.
            But last year I realized that I found ICT really fun and I decided that I was going to follow that passion.
            I
            want to prove to everyone and mostly myself, that I can be a good ICT-er as well. Even if my dad was very
            successful and even if there are very few women in ICT.</p>
        <h2>Why I chose this study programme</h2>
        <p>At first I considered working at a firm where I could grow into being a software developer. But for me it is
            better to learn the matter in a class and be more confident in the matter before I pursue a career.
            I chose this study programme because it is very project-based with real companies with real questions. I
            think
            it is good to learn in projects and by finding things out yourself. In that way you can prepare better for a
            future career, where you will likely have to work in groups and they don&#8217t spell everything out for
            you.
            I chose the international program, because the main language in ICT is English. It will give me more
            opportunities in the future as of pursuing a good career, but It will also add to my personal development.

                    On Friday 15 sept I had my first pitch for my website. After this pitch, I received some points of feedback from two
                    teachers and also from some of the other students. I added them together to form a tasklist for myself, I also listed the 
                    compliments I received.<br><br>
                    <b>Tasklist</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add some space to the sides, it seems very crowded</li>
                        <li>The links in the footer are in Times New Roman, you should change it so it fits more in your design</li>
                        <li>You forgot to add the article element to all pages</li>
                        <li>Make sure that the HZ logo is not cut off at the side</li>
                        <li>Structure the CSS file and make sure that you don't use inline-styling in the HTML-files.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>Compliments</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Well-structured code and files</li>
                        <li>Good naming</li>
                        <li>Nice design</li>
                    </ul>

        <h4>By making a SWOT-analysis, you analyse your personal strengths and weaknesses and make an inventory of the
            opportunities and threats you expect in your studies. </h4>
        <p><i>Strengths - What do you do best? What are your positive traits?</i><br>
        <ol>
            <li>I have followed several basic courses about programming</li>
            <li>Perseverance</li>
            <li>Collaborate</li>
            <li>Planning</li>
            <li>Self-disciplined</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <i>Weaknesses - What personality traits may be holding you back in your studies/career?</i><br>
        <ol>
            <li>I experience stress very fast</li>
            <li>Perfectionism</li>
            <li>Performance anxiety</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <i>Opportunities - How can you turn your strengths/weaknesses into opportunities?</i><br>
        Because I can plan very well, I can reduce most of the stress. When you want to have a job in ICT,
        especially as a woman, perseverance is a good trait. Also, in most companies you work in groups to do a project,
        so it is good to be good at collaboration. The perfectionism is a weakness, because it is never enough. When I
        try to reduce it to a place that at some point, it is enough and it is finished, I will make very good products.
        <br><br>
        <i>Threats - What obstacles do you face to succeed as a student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from
            succeeding in your studies/career?</i><br>
        The stress and the perfectionism are a big threat, those were the reasons that I had to quit my previous study
        program. But I have grown a lot since then, I know how to handle the stress and when I plan everything well and
        I keep telling myself that it is good enough, I am certain I will succeed in the studies and in a further
        career.

                    I am and what things I like to do, <a href="profile.html">go here.</a> On this page,
                    you&#8217ll see an introduction to my motivation for the choice for ICT. I elaborate

                <h3>Why ICT Field</h3>
                <p>I tried a studies called &#x0022Toegepaste Wiskunde&#x0022 (Applied Mathematics) a few years ago, but
                    it didn&#8217t work out. In the study programme were some courses related to ICT, and that really
                    grabbed my attention. I have worked a year at Roompot at the Systemmanagement and Project
                    department, where we had to use and maintain (from the front-end) some systems, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Maxxton Software</li>
                    <li>Newyse</li>
                    <li>UPTA</li>
                    <li>CASman</li>
                </ul>
                I really enjoyed when we had workshops from the different companies where they showed us a quick
                overview of how they made the systems and changed things. I really liked that part more than only
                working from the front-end. This is one of the reasons that the ICT field interested me. For the
                reason why it is the best choice for me, take a look at my Blog-page.</p>

                <h3>Why an ICT studies</h3>
                <p>SO I figured out that I wanted to do something with ICT. I tried a couple online courses of
                    Programming, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Visual Basic</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                </ul>
                They were really interesting, but when I started the JavaScript and Java courses, things became a lot
                harder. I decided that it was better to have more support from real-life teachers that I could bother
                with my questions. That's why I chose for a full-time ICT-programme.

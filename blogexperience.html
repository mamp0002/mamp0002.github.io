        <p>I have some programming experience, this is mostly due to my hobbies and interests, but also prior education.
            In my last studies I had courses about basic programming and Python and Visual Basic. After that, I followed
            some basic online courses about HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java and C++.</p>

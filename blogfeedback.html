        <p>I received some points of feedback on my Who-Am-I document. The first point was that I really have to explore
            and find out what my inner drive is for this study programme and ICT in general. With just &#x0022I like
            programming, I think it&#8217s fun&#x0022 you are probably not going to get far, because eventually you will come
            across a programming language that you really hate.
            I have thought about this part of the feedback and I have added some things to the blogpost about my study
            choice. I think I have found what drives me.<br><br>
            The second point was about the SWOT Analysis. I want everything to be perfect and that gives me stress. Also
            with this website, every day I am thinking &#x0022No it&#8217s not good enough, I have to change everything&#x0022. The
            feedback was mostly &#x0022less is more&#x0022, with the following tips:
            <ul>
                <li>Set an alarm when you are studying, for when you have to stop and go do something else.</li>
                <li>In the evening, when a lot of things pop into your head about what you need to do, write them down and
                    leave them.</li>
                <li>In the morning, begin with the one thing that has to be finished by the end of the day.</li>
                <li>Spend one hour less on school than your fellow classmates, you need the time to evaluate and recover
                    from the day.</li>
            </ul>
            A fellow student has kind of the same problem with this, and we agreed that we will look out for each other so 
            that we are not doing too much.
